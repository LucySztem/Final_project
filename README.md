# Final_project
Final project for Coders Lab

“Fiesta app” is designed to help users manage events (especially house-parties). 

The main aim of the app is to help people predict the budget that will be needed for the party, depending on the amount of the people, by having access to data from previous events.
 Other users, that will attend the party can contribute by posting on the event page what they will bring from food and drinks. 


Further implementations:

- invite other users;
- add photos;
- add posts on the event page;
- upload photos;
- a page with statistics from the parties so everyone have access to data needed in creating a budget.

Technologies used: Spring, Hibernate, MySQL, Spring Security, HTML, CSS
